Data structures and algorithms for competitive programming in Haskell

### Restrictions
- The libraries used are limited to what is, for now, available on Codeforces. These are probably the [Haskell Hierarchical Libraries](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/libraries/index.html), though I did not find an official statement. [Relevant blog](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/79).

### Notes to myself
- Keep it short
- Keep it functional
- Use ST only if it would increase complexity otherwise
- git gud
